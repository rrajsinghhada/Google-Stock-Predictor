# Google-Stock-Predictor
 
## Goal
To harness the power of LSTM models, use it to analyze past data of Google stock and employ it to predict the performance of Google stock  in January 2022.
## Data 
I utilized the Google stock data sourced from Kaggle, spanning from 2004 to 2022, which comprises over 4000 rows.

##Mathod used to improve the performance
* I utilized the previous 60 stock values, representing approximately three months of historical data, as the dependent variable.
* I employed a four-layer LSTM architecture to construct the RNN model, and I conducted tests using varying unit values for each layer.
* Through meticulous manual splitting of the dataset into training and test data, I put the model to the ultimate test, culminating in an outstanding prediction that solidifies its remarkable performance.
